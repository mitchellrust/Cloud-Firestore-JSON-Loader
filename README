Files directory should contain files of JSON data you want uploaded to Firestore.

The name format for these files is collection.json, where collection is the name of
the Firestore collection you want that files objects to be uploaded to.

Files should contain an array of JSON objects that will be uploaded.

Note that a randomly auto-generated id will be created for each document, and that id
will be added to the object with the field of "id".
